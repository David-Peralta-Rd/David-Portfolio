I don't allow the use of my avatar images, so if you use this portfolio, please be considerate and change the images. The background image is called:

- "home_1.jpg"

The avatar image is called:
- "about_me.png"

Both are in the "src/media/backgroud" folder.

Modify them and enjoy. I don't mind sharing this portfolio. If you find it useful, use it, but change and modify it to your liking. Don't leave any information or projects about me.

Modify the projects with the .js scripts in "src/modules."

That's all I'd say. Enjoy it and good luck.
