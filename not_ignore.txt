Hi, in case I don't include the images I use in my portfolio, I'll tell you what you need to do.

First step:

- Create some folders inside src "media/background"

Once you create the "media/background" folder,

Add an image you want to use as a presentation background. Name it:

- "home_1.jpg"

Second: In the same "src/media/background" folder, you need to add a
profile image, which can be found in the circular "About Me" section.
For this, the image must be named: "about_me.png"

That's all. There will be modifications, as I'll customize it to my liking.
